# 9. Docker-Composer-Ansible-Fabric

The purpose of this experiment is to construct a deploy flow around docker-compose together with fabric.

- We'll orchestate using ansible and vagrant, like previous experiments.
- Setup and handle containers with docker-compose
- Use fabric to push and handle images and trigger container restarts
- Lets begin!
